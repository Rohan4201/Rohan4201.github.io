## Introduction


In a world where information is abundant but attention is scarce, understanding how we learn—and how we can learn better—has never been more critical. Dr. Terry Sejnowski, a professor of computational neurobiology at the Salk Institute and a pioneer in computational neurobiology, recently sat down with Andrew Huberman on the Huberman Lab Podcast to explore the intersection of neuroscience, artificial intelligence (AI), and learning. He sheds light on how we can improve our learning abilities using insights from neuroscience and artificial intelligence (AI). His discussion, hosted on the **Huberman Lab Podcast**, explores the foundational principles of brain function, AI-assisted learning, and practical strategies to enhance cognition.



## The Three Levels of Brain Understanding


Dr. Sejnowski introduces the concept of the "algorithmic level" of brain function, which sits between the implementation level (how mechanisms work) and the behavioral level (overall system behavior). This level focuses on how neural circuits use algorithms to process information, bridging the gap between structure and function.

The brain uses algorithms, much like a recipe, to achieve specific outcomes. These algorithms are crucial for understanding how we learn and adapt. This concept is also emerging in AI, where algorithms are used to simulate human-like learning processes.

Traditionally, scientists have employed two main approaches to studying the brain:
1. **Bottom-up approach** – Examining individual components (molecules, synapses, neurons) to understand connectivity and development.
2. **Top-down approach** – Observing behavior and deriving laws of behavior, as seen in psychology and early AI models.

However, both approaches have their limitations. The bottom-up approach can get lost in the complexity of the brain, while the top-down approach often fails to explain the underlying mechanisms. Hence, Sejnowski advocates for a third, **algorithmic-level approach**, which acts as a bridge between structure and function, much like how computer programs define sequential steps to achieve specific goals. This perspective is revolutionizing both neuroscience and AI by helping researchers understand how neural circuits use algorithms to process information.


## The Basal Ganglia and Learning Sequences


One of the most fascinating insights comes from Sejnowski’s discussion on the **basal ganglia**, a brain region below the cortex that plays a crucial role in learning action sequences to achieve goals, and helps us refine movements and cognitive processes through repetitive learning. Whether you're learning to play tennis or mastering a new language, the basal ganglia is at work. This system is critical for:
- **Motor learning:** Through repeated practice, the basal ganglia refines movements, taking over from the cortex to produce increasingly precise actions - Practicing skills like playing tennis or musical instruments.
- **Cognitive development:** This process isn't limited to physical skills. It also applies to cognitive tasks, such as enhancing expertise in fields like finance or medicine.
- **Predicting rewards:** The basal ganglia refines actions by continuously updating a "value function," much like AI reinforcement learning models.


### AI and Learning Optimization


The brain uses a value function to predict the reward of an action and updates its synapses based on the actual outcome. 

Example: When you order a dish at a restaurant, your brain predicts its value based on past experiences. If the dish exceeds expectations, your brain updates its value function for future decisions.

AI systems like **AlphaGo** developed by DeepMind, the AI that beat the world Go champion, use similar reinforcement learning mechanisms, where value functions improve performance through iterative learning. Understanding this principle can help humans optimize their own learning strategies.



## The Two Types of Learning Systems


Sejnowski highlights two major learning systems in humans:
1. **Cognitive Learning (Cortical System)** – Engages conscious reasoning, memorization, and step-by-step analysis.
2. **Procedural Learning (Basal Ganglia)** – Operates subconsciously, helping with skill automation through practice.


### Importance of Procedural Learning


Many modern education systems focus excessively on cognitive learning while neglecting procedural learning. For example, reading about swimming in a book does not compare to actual swimming practice. This highlights the need for:
- **Homework and problem-solving exercises** to reinforce concepts.
- **Physical and mental repetition** to strengthen neural pathways.
- **A combination of theory and application** for deep learning.


### The “Learning How to Learn” MOOC


Sejnowski and **Barbara Oakley** developed a **free online course**, [Learning How to Learn](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn), which has been taken by over **4 million people worldwide**. The course covers:
- Techniques to overcome procrastination.
- Strategies to improve memory and recall.
- Methods to deal with exam anxiety.
- The science behind effective learning practices.




## Neuroscience of Memory and Sleep



### Sleep Spindles and Memory Consolidation



During light, slow-wave sleep, circular traveling waves called sleep spindles occur in the cortex. These spindles are crucial for consolidating daily experiences into long-term memory. E.g. The hippocampus replays experiences during sleep, and sleep spindles help integrate them into the cortex without overwriting existing knowledge.

Sejnowski discusses how **sleep spindles**, circular traveling waves in the cortex, help transfer information from short-term to long-term memory. These waves occur during light slow-wave sleep and are essential for:
- Reinforcing daily experiences.
- Strengthening neural connections.
- Enhancing overall cognitive performance.

Hence Sejowski suggests toprioritize quality sleep to enhance memory consolidation and learning. A practical tip - actively think about a problem before going to sleep. During sleep, your brain will work on the problem, potentially leading to a solution upon waking, and avoid watching TV or engaging in distracting activities before bed. Instead, focus on the problem you're trying to solve.



### The Role of Ambien in Sleep Research



Sarah Bednick’s research at **UC Irvine** found that **Ambien (Zolpidem)** doubles the number of sleep spindles, leading to improved memory consolidation. However, it also causes **anterograde amnesia**, making users forget events that occur after taking the drug. This paradox underscores the delicate balance between cognitive enhancement and unintended side effects.



## The Impact of Stress and Exercise on Learning


### Stress as a Cognitive Enhancer


Contrary to popular belief, controlled amounts of stress can **improve learning** by boosting focus and engagement. Sejnowski compares this to:
- **Interval training in exercise**, where short bursts of high intensity improve fitness.
- **Increasing cognitive velocity**, where reading or listening at a slightly faster pace enhances retention.


### Exercise and Mitochondrial Function



As we age, **mitochondrial efficiency** declines, making learning more difficult. Regular exercise is one of the best ways to combat this, as it:
- Replenishes mitochondrial function.
- Boosts brain plasticity and cognitive health.
- Strengthens the immune system and overall well-being.

Sejnowski himself engages in **daily beach runs and hiking**, emphasizing the importance of maintaining physical activity for brain health.



## AI’s Role in Predicting Future Scenarios



A fascinating concept discussed in the podcast is using **AI to predict potential future outcomes**. Unlike human experts, AI can:
- Analyze vast datasets without fatigue.
- Generate multiple possible futures.
- Help with strategic decision-making across industries.
