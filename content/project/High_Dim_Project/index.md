**Summary of the project:**

  - Usual dimension reduction techniques are linear in nature
  - This project was about introducing few novel approaches in literature for non-linear dimension reduction
  - Brief discussion on Dimension reduction, Kernel PCA, Multidimensional Scaling (MDS), Locally Linear Embedding (LLE), t-SNE, Diffusion Map.
  - Basic comparison of these methods on a non-linear data
