**Summary of the project:**

- Study several dynamic network models inliterature

- Study several network summary stastics in context of statistical inference in networks

- Provide theoretical results on the edge density of the dynamic network model by Matias and Miele (2017)

- Inference on asymptotic distribution of edge density via simulations
