**Summary of the project:**

  - Web Scraped votes and ratings from the IMDb webpage, and the list of directors, writers and air dates of each episode of Naruto Shippuden anime using the 'rvest' package of R 
  - Cleaned the data for further data analysis (most of the web scraping was done to ensure that the resultant data remains clean)
  - Provided a few data visualizations for basic EDA
  - Working on providing a well-explanatory model for the prediction of ratings and the type of anime episode from the different variables within the data
