**Summary of the project:**

- Provided Exploratory data analysis using Choropleth maps to identify regions with high food insecurity

- Conducted Linear Regression Analysis and Linear Discriminant Analysis on relevant metrics

- Used K-Nearest Neighbor Classifier using relevant variables to classify Low Access regions

- Provided a Logistic Regression model to predict Low Income-Low Access tracts based on other relevant variables with a high AUROC ( Area under the Receiver Operating Characteristics curve) of 0.89
